## Meeting w/ Aaron Lockey and Saraniya

Mark Mucklow owns everything from fulfillment to last mile. So far it seems like there's no way to inject availability or inventory into the system.

If we had a high confidence PO, then we could support inventory from OD or Grand & Toy or a 3P Partner.

Federation partners are handled today in our warehouses, with a different customer type with a customer ID... It's handled by AOPS (an order processing system). This solution has it's own GL, own account codes, and its own demand in the Blue Yonder (formerly called JDA) system. Blue Younder generates the forecast, which foes into the mainframe, which orders the supplies. 80% of the forecasting is automated. 20% is handled manually... high-value and select skus requiring special handling. Merchants (vendor managers) can influence the inventory placement. 

When a ODP issues a PO to a vendor for a product they get ship dates, estimated arrival dates and then they get ASNs. PO numbers include the warehouse number and that determination is made up front. There's no inventory rebalancing. 40% gets crossdocked to go to stores, the other 53% is for B2B fulfillment. Not sure about B2C.
