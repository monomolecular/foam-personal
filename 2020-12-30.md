## Requirements/Design Meeting for Marketplace

Attendees: [[Vinay Kavala]], [[Saraniya Senthamarai]], [[Tamil Radhakrishnan]], [[Melissa Malinovsky]], and [[Scott Headberg]]

Notes from [[Vinay Kavala]]...

- Pricing at a Customer level is helpful for 2 reasons
  - A/B testing can be easy :-)
  - Individual Customer pricing for better satisfaction and not affecting any other customers pricing
- Prices will be targeted w.r.t segments or individual customers
- OD Operator can create few transparent basic segments which Suppliers can see
- Supplier can either choose one from them or he can have his own segment targetting
  - he can always match his segments to the OD Operator model of pricing(segment)
  - WWW Consumer marketplace
    - OD is the operator defining the segments
    - Self Service registration
    - Customers are in the same Consumer Segment - as defined by the OD Operator
      - general consumers
      - micro & small businesses (business select) - less than 20 employees
      - reward members
  - BSD Business marketplace
    - OD is the operator
      - SMB customers > 20 employees
      - Enterprise Customers
    - Managed Accounts - not self-service registration
  - Grand & Toy Business marketplace
    - Self Service registration
    - Grand & Toy is the operator
      - SMB Customers()
    - Attributes used for targeting
      - geo-location

## [[Project Zelda]] Due Dilligence for Aquisition

Discussion with Lawyers and [[Daniel Smith]] about the Zelda project. Discussion was focussed on the open source review and other code review possibilities. I listed scalability and modularity as potential review items, code quality/documentation, security was suggested and so was a review of proper use of Magentoo. [Black Duck](https://www.blackducksoftware.com/) and Lexara were potential 3rd parties we could use for these reviews. Black Duck is really the best for only Open Source software use, and potentially Magentoo.

Black Duck can evaluate the use of 3rd party APIs again for security.

We also need to ensure that the aquisition target is open to a code review.

Separately we need a priotitized list of things that we want to verify pre and post-deal. We can use this list to make a priority and have a threshold for what we must know before signing the deal, vs nice to know and should know after the deal is closed. Priority should be based on our assumptions about ability to acclerate the business.

## 1:1 w/ [[Terry Leeper]]

Checked and we need to use the 3rd party for the code review.
AI: Give Terry some feedback about his list of thoughts for the board.

## [[Advanced 3P]]

AI: I volunteered to share my Marketplace Vision & Architecture document to the group so that they can share it out with their leaders. Due: This Weekend.

Terry is concerned about the false persception that aquiring Zelda will accellerate us dramatically. Their Magentoo usage might prevent that. It may not jump our roadmap towards certain types of solutions, ale gets ion oniroffice Depot is probably a rounding error on the original one. is probably a rounding error on the original one.

Terry said [[Prentis Wilson]] said "he kind of feels jipped that we don't actually have a marketplace"... therefore we're not as afar along as they thought. The quisition is supposed to address that, and Terry has concerns that that's not true.

AI: Does the buyer quest acquisition give us better source-to-settle functionality and thereby focus on a different set of customers and scenarios?A

IAI: Does bBuyerQuest give us any functionality that changes the architectural and product build out plans?
Question: Is there functionality of theirs that can just be called through APIs?

No investment in CompuCom...

Tell Alnoor want's he's read in that hat there are no hire priorities than B-Comm.
