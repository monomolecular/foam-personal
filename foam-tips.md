# Foam Tips

-- to get the most out of your Foam workspace

- Reference the [foam documentation workspace](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.
- For up-to-date tips, see [Foam Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes).
- You can `Ctrl`+`Click` markup links like [[todo]], [[inbox]], or [[readme]].
- After installation, you can edit [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) and add or remove any settings for your Foam workspace.

## To-Do Tips

- You can mark to-do's complete with `Alt`+`C`, and this works across multiple lines if selected.
- The [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) plugin by [Yu Zhang](https://github.com/yzhang-gh) provides a bunch of useful features for to-do lists.
