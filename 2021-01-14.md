## Architecture Findings

Findings for [[project-zelda]]...
What's our ability to re-use the business logic?
* d

How's it look from a modularity perspective?

* Mick: We only saw one modulke. They're all intertwined and talking to each other. For example the pay module is integrated into 4 or 5 other modules... not via an API.


Would a rewrite be required? 

* Rich: Because Magento is the core, you have no choice without a big re-write mean that you couldn't replace or integrate someting like search easily. But it won't be a complete rewrite.
* Mick... It's like they're including classes within a class and calling PHP methods of the sub-classes.
* It has MVC with an internal separation of presentation layer from business logic. There's no mechanism like a Restful API. It could be accomplished without a complete rewrite.They have their own very flat databases where they could. 
  
Tech commitment to the existing customers?

* They only commit to three month roadmap.

## B-Comm Sync with SCS

* They've made progress with Xerox as a customer of SCS.
* They've got a deal going with Google to do a punch-out to BSD for shirts for associates. They're using the JLL Buying Group.
