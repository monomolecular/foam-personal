# Susanta Sahoo

Full Name: Susanta Kumar Sahoo

Email: susantak.sahoo@gmail.com

Start Date: Late Jan or February

New employee working for me, will need to go under an SDM I hire.

Summary notes from interview:

Susanta lives in Seattle. He's open to staying there to work remotely or moving where we need him. He finished the interviews successfully, but we haven't given him a verbal offer. His comp requirement is $145k+ but the Boca team isn't interested in going that high.

His HackerRank test score is 76%, which is far above the average. Here are the highlights from the interviewers. Mostly positive, but he didn't get stellar feedback from Anu (a Lead Developer on the team in Boca):

* Alex: Familiar with all key concepts of modern microservice development; has experience building microservices using async communication via Kafka. Has application development expertise. Good troubleshooting abilities, has a well- defined position on circuit breaking, caching. Well versed with Spring/Spring Boot.
* Anu: Communication was challenging, and he was clearly nervous.  He is a seasoned developer who can learn technologies and work well with others.  He will require technical direction.
* Sabina & Emile: Good communication skills. Team player and eager to learn new things.
