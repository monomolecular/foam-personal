Today we got an acceptance from [[Chaitali Meshram]] who will be my level 26 Sr. Lead Product Manager.

## MS Discussions

I'm a mid-size company, base or premium subscriber of business central and I will get access to b-comm either (model 1) included in the price, or (model 2) for an upsell charge (lower friction but less lift for other channel partners*).

*Partners get usually a 20% wholesale discount for resale. Then back-end post-sale they can get incentives paid out based on volume of sales they drive... ~6% paid out fixed, but more sales translate to larger incentive payout from MS.

Pricing is gauranteed for a 12 month term. If its resold in the window the price is locked. If they want to sell a new SKU, it's priced at the current price. Team member users are not free and they add up in subscription revenue.

Business Central Customers have ~10 seats per, regardless of size. They have a separate team-member users which can create requisitions but have lesser capability.

If we add b-comm, it should drive team-member

Pre Negotiated Discounts are going to be a requirement... are 1-off suppliers required as well?

Tech Deep Dive... what does the experience look like... customer process map, CTO with functional knowledge and no art skills would want. And then the t-shirt costing as a result of that.
